# CSEC-759-Project
Automate Vulnerability Scanning Using a CodeBERT-Based Model

This project fine-tuned a CodeBERT-based model to automate the detection of vulnerabilities in source code. It focuses on analyzing vulnerable code patterns to assist in identifying security issues.

## Resources
- **CodeBERT**: The model architecture used in this project is based on Microsoft's [CodeBERT](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeBERT).

## Datasets
Due to the large size of the datasets, they are not included in this repository. However, you can access them via the following links:
- **CVEfixes**: [Vulnerable and Fixed Code Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/girish17019/cvefixes-vulnerable-and-fixed-code)
- **DiverseVul**: [DiverseVul Dataset](https://github.com/wagner-group/diversevul)

## Trained Models and Tokenized Data
Trained models and tokenized datasets are not included in the repository due to their size.
